##question from slack: Is there any differences between 'st_read' and 'read_sf'?
Adam Dennett: [not really](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_read.html)"read_sf and write_sf are aliases for st_read and st_write, respectively, with some modified default arguments. read_sf and write_sf are quiet by default: they do not print information about the data source. read_sf returns an sf-tibble rather than an sf-data.frame. write_sf delete layers by default: it overwrites existing files without asking or warning."
